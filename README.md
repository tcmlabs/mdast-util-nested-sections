# mdast-util-nested-sections

Markdown heading ranges as nested as sections in [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast).

Leverages [mdast-util-heading-range](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-heading-range) under the hood.

## Purpose

The idea is to return a tree of sections instead of a flat list of sibling headings with content from a markdown file.

The goal is to allow for easier styling of wrappers and containers around each level of sections, all in a recursive way.

## Installation

```bash
npm install mdast-util-nested-sections
```

## Usage

Coming soon. Until now, have a look at the source code.
